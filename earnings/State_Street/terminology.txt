The "net income per share" in the news article, $1.42, is referred to as "Diluted earnings per common share" in the income statement ([[http://investors.statestreet.com/CustomPage/Index?KeyGenPage=1073749953|Quarterly Earnings]] -> 2Q19 Financial Tables -> pg 3). It is also referred to as "Diluted earnings per common share, GAAP-basis" later ([[http://investors.statestreet.com/CustomPage/Index?KeyGenPage=1073749953|Quarterly Earnings]] -> 2Q19 Financial Tables -> pg 15).
Q. Is "Diluted earnings per common share" always computed on a GAAP-basis unless otherwise mentioned?

Questions:
Q. In the income statement
[[http://investors.statestreet.com/CustomPage/Index?KeyGenPage=1073749953|Quarterly Earnings]] -> 2Q19 Financial Tables -> pg 3 -> Income statement
there are two entries: "Net income", "Net income available to common shareholders". How are the two different?
A. Net income available to common shareholders = Net income - Adjustments to net income
where
Adjustments to net income = Dividends on preferred stock - Earnings allocated to participating securities 

See pg-5 where net income is broken down into Dividends on preferred stock, Earnings allocated to participating securities, and Net income available to common shareholders.
