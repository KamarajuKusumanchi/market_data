This directory contains data upto 2018 only.  From 2019 onwards, Berkshire has
stopped publishing "in Per-Share Book Value of Berkshire" in their annual
letters. For example, the 2019 letter
(https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2019ltr.pdf) only shows "in
Per-Share Market Value of Berkshire", "in S&P 500 with Dividends Included".
